# human-or-neural-translation-demo
A small repro of the ["Human or Neural Translation?"](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.576/) paper by Bhardwaj et al.

## Preparing the dataset

Download and untar the da-en file found [here](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/). Once untarred, run `python split.py && python translate.py`.

## Running the experiments

Open the notebook in this directory with jupyter. If you have the dependencies installed and have a GPU, all should be well...
